This project involves the implementation of the popular puzzle game, 2048. The game is played by merging tiles of the same number using arrow keys to move left, right, up, or down. The goal is to reach the coveted 2048 tile by continuously merging numbered (non-zero) tiles.

The game's representation is a 4Ã—4 array of integers, where 0's denote empty tiles. The focus of the project is on implementing individual operations within the Board class, which houses all the methods necessary for a functioning 2048 game. Two drivers, text and animated, are provided for testing purposes.
