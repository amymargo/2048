2048 is a puzzle game where you use the arrow keys to move left, right, up or down to merge tiles of the same number together.

The goal of the game is to keep merging numbered tiles until you get one 2048 tile. If two tiles with the same number touch each other, they are merged together in the direction swiped into a new tile with twice the value. Be careful with your moves – if the board is full at the end of a turn and there are no other valid moves, it’s game over!

The Board class contains all methods that construct a functioning 2048 game. This is the file in which I wrote all my code in.
